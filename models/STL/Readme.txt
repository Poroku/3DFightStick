LeftPlate for arcade joystick layout.
LeftPlateMix for cherry mx switches layout.

Generally print everything with supports enabled.

  The exceptions are:
    1. Lock Screw model
    2. Tapped hole on the side of L/R bases
    
As always, orient to print with the least supports.
Make sure supports are tuned to be easy to remove. They are quite numerous for the L/R bases and control center models.

Some fasteners used were not ideal (by length/head type), but was lying around in house. Use whatever works.
Fasteners used for my build: (+) for mounting joystick
  4x M4x0.7x10mm, Countersick Philips Head
    +4x M4x0.7x10mm, Hex Head
  2x #8-32 x 1 in, Rounded Philips Head. 
    +4x #8-32 x 1 in, Rounded Philips Head
  4x M4x0.7 nut
  2x #8 nut
    +4x #8 nut
    
Added rubber foam pads at the bottom to prevent slip from lap. Also prevent the round head screws I used from being an issue (back to the not ideal fasterner type described above).

A tap drill was used to the pillars of the joystick mount. Change to printed threads in SolidWorks, if preferred.
The slots on the control center were designed for 12x12mm pushbuttons. Change this as well, if preferred.
The faces for the control buttons were hot glued onto the buttons. The buttons are also glued to the control center.
