Generally print everything with supports enabled.

  The exceptions are:
    1. Lock Screw model
    2. Tapped hole on the side of L/R bases
    
As always, orient to print with the least supports.
Make sure supports are tuned to be easy to remove. They are quite numerous for the L/R bases and control center models.

A tap drill was used to the pillars of the joystick mount. Change to printed threads in SolidWorks, if preferred.
The slots on the control center were designed for 12x12mm pushbuttons. Change this as well, if preferred.
The faces for the control buttons were hot glued onto the buttons. The buttons are also glued to the control center.
