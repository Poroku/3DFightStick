Generally print everything with supports enabled.
  The exceptions are:
    1. Lock Screw model
    2. Tapped hole on the side of L/R bases
    
As always, orient to print with the least supports.
Make sure supports are tuned to be easy to remove. They are quite numerous for the L/R bases and control center models.
